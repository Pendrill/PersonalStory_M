I need to finish my work (mouseclick).
But this comp sci stuff is hard.
The deadline is approaching.
But maybe i want to take a little break.
There are a lot of things 
to see in the house
I can use WASD to move
and my mouse to look around
I can press Left Mouse to interact 
with objects
and press 1, 2, 3 to change 
the modes of interaction
Let's go explore and not work!
